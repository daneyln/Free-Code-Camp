# Free-Code-Camp

Welcome to Daney's Free-Code-Camp wiki!

This is my journal as I go accomplishing the Challenges and Project on Free Code Camp

Why have I finally decided to put it in public? Well... after so much thought... to record my progress with all the errors and everything. So I can learn from my own mistakes and hopefully can also help my friends with... and anyone really.

Feel free to contact me and Happy coding!
